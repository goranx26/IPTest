# IPTest
Takes (or makes one for you) an IP-address and netmask,
then proceeds to ask questions about it. Like the network-ID, first/last host and so on.

It it a practice project in line with my n00b python skills.

TODO:
Verify if address is local/reserved
Look at the netmask input and rephrase the question accordingly.
Figure out the subnet part...
Make tests.
Tidy up the code and comment.
Modules? Classes?
GUI?
